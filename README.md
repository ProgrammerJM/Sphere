## Sphere

Sphere is a social media web app created by John Mark Tizado because of boredom to his current work.

This is a side project to upskill in preparation for his next/future job.

## Technology Stack

Sphere is built using a modern technology stack to ensure scalability, performance, and ease of development. The following technologies are used:

1. **Next.js** - A React framework for server-side rendering and generating static websites.
2. **Clerk** - Authentication and user management.
3. **Shadcn/UI** - A component library for building user interfaces.
4. **TailwindCSS** - A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
5. **Neon** - A serverless Postgres database platform.
6. **PostgreSQL** - A powerful, open-source relational database system.
7. **Prisma** - An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool for database management.

These technologies collectively provide a robust foundation for developing and maintaining the Sphere web app.
